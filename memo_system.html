<h2> Memo system </h2>

<p> For many years now, I have been maintaining an ever growing, cross-linked personal memo system.
</p>
<p>
The website you are looking is, to a large extent, a partial view on this material.
</p>
<p> I guess you could call the whole thing a mind map, but it started out purely as a filing system.
From early on, I used to collect clippings and notes, first in piles, then in binders, then in folders,
 then in filing cabinets, only to find that in the end systematically grouping the material was bound to fail.
Many colleagues had the same problem, and most of them took refuge in a chronological system of notebooks and reports.
One of them referred to his desk as "my piling system".
</p>
<p> Any other order than chronological is prone to redundancy. Most subjects belong to different classes : a single thought or clipping
 can simultaneously belong to the categories of aircraft, mathematics,
  mechanical engineering, design methodology, and career planning.
 I started making copies of the same article for different folders, 
 and then could not locate the copy that I had scribbled my notes on.
</p>
<p> At the same time personal computers and word processors were becoming affordable,
 and around 1996 I decided to organize my material, first work only
 and later everything in sight, into a system of Word documents linked 
back and forth by hyperlinks. Typically, every memo starts with a list of
 between 5 and 50 links to various other memo's.
There is a central memo called "index.doc", which is an (inverse) 
chronological list of all the others. The contents of these memo's vary from the yearly memo with 
doggerel poetry for that year's St. Nicholas presents, to 100 page treatises on arcane subjects.
</p>
<p>
The proper granularity of such memo's is an issue. I find that typically, 
sticking to a clear subject per memo limits the size to about 5 pages, which can be taken in at a glance.
It works best for me to start a new memo for every subject which can be given a clear title, 
whether a visit to a particular lab, or a particular piece of analysis.

</p>
<p> This system has become an asset and a liability, I guess. At times the overhead   
of starting a new memo for every little subject becomes oppressive,
 and at times I am very happy that I can find notes and analyses
 from 30 years ago with ease, and link new subjects quickly to several other building blocks.
