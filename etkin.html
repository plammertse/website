<h2> Intro </h2>

<p> In the 1980's, Etkin's book was the classic on Flight Dynamics, or as it was also called "Aircraft Stability and Control".
The edition of choice was the 2n edition, but see the tab on Etkin editions.
</p>

<!--
<p> Another classic at the time was McRuer, Ashkenas et al. In retrospect, maybe I like that one better.
There are many others, like McCormick etc.
</p>
<p> I wish we had used one of these classics in our classes.
I only got to know them much later.
</p> 
<p> I recently looked into Etkin for model data and eigenvectors of actual aircraft.
I remembered his models were in the non-dimensional form, with a peculiar non-dimensional time derivative he called <b> Dc </b>,
based on the airplane's chord <b>c</b>, 
which he also used for the asymmetric part of the system equations as a first step towards computer calculation.
</p>

<p> Etkin was a professor at UTIAS in Toronto, which I believe was a center of excellence at the time,
especially in flight simulation. 
There was a line of descendancy in Toronto from Etkin, to Reid, to Nahon and Kirdeikis and later Advani, in motion cueing algorithms for flight simulation, 
which I think inspired the work in Delft on high quality motion systems with hydrostatic bearings.
