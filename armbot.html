<h2> The Armbot exoskeleton </h2>
<p> While at Moog, around 2009 I started the development of a novel arm exoskeleton.
It is mechanically balanced, so the mechanism gently floats when it is not powered.
<p> Bias forces (or rather, torques) are added to the arm by motors on the floor, 
with force sensors near the motor and admittance control to free up the motion completely.
By a simple mechanism (modified Galloway), &plusmn45&deg joint angles are transmitted
from the motors to the elbow and even wrist by simple lightweight pushrods over several links
with a total added in-between angle of more than 180&deg.
</p>
<p> All the human joints are driven in torque only. This feels completely unforced and natural.
The other DOF's (trans&shylations of all the joints, including the shoulder and the torso)
are not driven, but instead freed up mechanic&shyally by the 90&deg angle at the top of the column.
This eliminates the usual ten minutes of "fitting" the patient at the start of a session.
 The exoskeleton simply does not fight, or even see any patient misalignments or synergies
 such as the shoulder lifting during abduction.
</p>
<p> The shoulder abduction torque is driven along a horizontal axis coming from 45&deg back.
This fits the human range of motion (ROM) quite closely, 
and since there is no translational forcing of the shoulder at all,
the shoulder is free to lift and rotate around any internal point.
</p>
</p>
<p>The video shows the final prototype in action.
The weight of the upper arm and forearm combined is supported by a settable vertical force, to unload the shoulder.
This force comes (via the linkage) from the floor motor and force sensor dedicated to this DOF.
The weight of the forearm, suspended from the upper arm link, is supported by a fully adaptive 
elbow flexion torque from a second chain of pushrods and motor.
Shoulder abduction is driven by a third floor motor rotating the red torque tube.
