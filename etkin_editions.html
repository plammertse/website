<h3> Etkin Edition History </h3>

<p> There are at least four versions of Etkin's book. 
Two of these are called 2nd edition, and one of them is called 3d edition. 
The first edition carries no explicit edition number.
I think the 2nd edition called "Dynamics of Atmospheric Flight" is the classic.
The 3d edition was new to me, and I feel it is by far the best version.
The differences are roughly as follows :
</p>

<h4> 1958 &emsp; Dynamics of Flight - Stability and Control - 1st edition </h4>

<p> This is a pleasant textbook on "Stabilty and Control".
The cover sports a B-58 Hustler.
</p>

<h4> 1972 &emsp; Dynamics of Atmospheric Flight - 2nd edition </h4>

<p> I think this is the classic we all knew and feared.
It is a complete overhaul of the first edition, with a slighlty different title;
but still, it is called the second edition.
This version has lavish attention to the complexities of hypersonic flight, around a curved Earth, and at quickly varying atmospheric pressures.
This made it far less suitable as an undergraduate textbook.
</p>

<h4> 1982 &emsp; Dynamics of Flight - Stability and Control - 2nd edition </h4>

<p> In his preface to this "other" second edition, Etkin confesses that he had received much negative feedback on his 1972 second edition as a textbook.
This new edition therefore returns to the format of the first edition, with certain modernizations.
Somewhat confusingly, but probably true to the facts, Etkin therefore calls this the "second edition", but this time of the first book with the original title.
This version deletes the last five chapters of the first edition, and replaces them by two new ones with material taken from the 1972 "second edition".
Relative to the first edition, this new second edition introduces the use of eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
Externally, the two very different "second editions" are very much alike, 
with black hardcover and metallic lettering spelling out “second edition”,
but internally they are very, very different. 

<h3> 1995 &emsp; Dynamics of Flight - Stability and Control - 3d edition </h3>

<p> The 3d edition is a true revision of the 2nd edition of the first book.
This version gives the equations of motion in dimensional form,
because it is more suitable for real-time computer simulation, like in flight simulators.
The model used is the Boeing 747 this time.The cover shows a double shadow image of that airplane.
</p>

<p> The prefaces of the books give a clear account of their development.
The 3d editon was co-written by Lloyd Reid, who had grown up with the previous versions, first a student and later as a staff member.
Etkin himself had been retired for eleven years by that time.
</p>

<h4> Assessment </h4>

<p> I believe that Etkin's 3d edition is as good a place to start as any when learning about aircraft dynamics, 
and the B747 is a good playground. <br> <br> </p>
