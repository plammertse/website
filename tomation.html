<h2> Tomation </h2>
<p> In 2004 we were approached for a workshop on agricultural robotics.
There is an area under Rotterdam called "the Westland" which is
 virtually covered in greenhouses,
and which employs people (and has a turnover) in excess of the whole port of Rotterdam.
The work in these greenhouses is repetitive,
 and there was a wish to automate it as much as possible.
</p>
<p> Robots were not at the stage they are now, but the main stumbling block
was the intelligence to guide them, in&nbsp;particular the interpretation
of the camera images used. Stacks of large computers were required to analyze very high
 definition video images, taking tens of seconds to interpret each image of the plant forest.
A path planning exercise followed, and then the robot would plow its way into the plant,
causing damage and not getting any new information out of the experience.
</p>
<p> Years before, in the context of autonomous zero-G flying with UAV's
 (now called drones, I suppose), I had been intrigued by books (see bottom of page)
 on autonomous mobile robots with "emergent" behavior. The simplest example would be the "bumper logic" 
which is probably still used today in robot vacuum cleaners.
</p>
<p> I found the idea of emergent behavior absolutely charming. 
It reminded me of Lorenz's research on digger wasps, who use a very limited
set of behavioral rules to accomplish seemingly complex tasks like 
returning to the tiny hole they dug before, from hundreds of meters away.
</p>
<p> Lorenz's research showed that even with their very limited vision and brain, 
they could recognize a pattern of a few leaves and small rocks near their nest and home in on it.
Their algorithm showed up because they could be easily fooled by moving the rocks.
They would repeatedly home in on the wrong spot now marked by the rocks.
<p> It occurred to me that these tiny insects did not need a supercomputer to navigate
 in the natural world. They live and survive by a minimalist set of sensors and behavioral rules.
</p>
<p> Coming from the haptics side, I felt that tactile or force sensing
 was an ideal extra sensor to add to the robot.
It&nbsp;could make the robot gentle, and avoid its damaging the plant.

<p>
<br> <i>
Explain use of force fields. Explain behavioral rules used in video. <br>
Explain how the movement itself gives visual information,
or at the very least gives increasingly better views (closer up, better angled and less obtructed). 
A large part of the motion is in fact intended to give a better visual. 
<br>Leaf pruning, not picking (yet).<br>
Maybe comment a bit on the politics here, or preferably elsewhere. </i>
